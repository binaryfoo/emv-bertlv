Some code for deciphering [BER TLV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.690#BER_encoding) data used in [EMV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV) (chip card transactions).

Source for the oddly named tool [tvr-decoder](http://tvr-decoder.appspot.com) running on Google's AppEngine. It started life decoding a single field from the EMV spec, the [TVR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_verification_results), and gained a bunch more features from there.
